## Analysis Approach

### Data Exploration
- Used `.describe()`, `.info()`, and `.value_counts()` for initial exploration
- Identified data ranges, distributions, and unique values

### Visualizations
1. **Pairplot**: Relationships between numerical variables
2. **Heatmap**: Correlation matrix of numerical features
3. **Boxplots**: Revenue distribution by category
4. **Time Series**: Monthly revenue trends
5. **Bar Charts**: Platform performance comparison
6. **Scatterplots**: Price vs. Units Sold relationships
